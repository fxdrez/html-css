        The magnificent mountains in the north, undulating slopes, passes, swift-flowing crystal-like rivers, lakes,
        valleys, tars, etc are attractive things that identify Nepal as a piece of heaven. It has been a major choice of
        a large number of foreign tourists for the last few decades. The world's highest mountain Mt. Everest, called
        the roof of the world identifies Nepal throughout the world. It also possesses a lake at the highest altitude,
        the deepest gorge, and so on.

        heritages that are listed in the World Heritage List such as Lumbini, Chitwan National Park, Sagarmatha National
        Park and many more introduce us as prosperous people of small heaven. Moreover, one can see several temples, and
        Kathmandu is a city of temples.

        It is the land that gave birth to world-famous persons. Gautam Buddha, the preacher of peace and founder of
        Buddhism, Prithivi Narayan Shah, the builder of modern unified Nepal. Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, the first human to
        reach the summit of Mt. Everest with Hilary, etc. were those who possessed to Nepal. Not only them, but brave

        Though Nepal is a <strong>multi-lingual, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious</strong> country, there has not been any
        conflict between any group in the name of language, religion, or ethnicity. the unity among diversity that is
        prevalent in Nepal proves that Nepalese are cooperative and peace-loving. It also inspires other nations to
        follow its people's harmonious unity. Nepalese people respect guests as their gods since there is a popular
        belief that "Atithi Debo Bhawa". It is a strong example to prove that Nepalese are spiritually rich though they
        are economically poor. Nepalese people love freedom and democracy. That is why they have fought several times
        for democracy through their leaders deceiving them time and again. Recently, Nepal has been declared a republic
        country and promulgated a new constituent.
