        Today I'm delighted to announce Willow, our latest quantum chip. Willow has state-of-the-art performance across
        a number of metrics, enabling two major achievements.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The first is that Willow can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits. This cracks a key
            challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Second, Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of
            today's
            <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/" target="_blank">fastest supercomputers</a> 10 septillion (that
            is, 1025) years
            — a number that vastly exceeds the age of the
            Universe.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Willow chip is a major step on a journey that began over 10 years ago. When I founded Google Quantum AI in
        2012, the vision was to build a useful, large-scale quantum computer that could harness quantum mechanics — the
        “operating system” of nature to the extent we know it today — to benefit society by advancing scientific
        discovery, developing <a href="https://quantumai.google/applications" target="_blank">helpful applications</a>,
        and tackling some of society's greatest challenges. As part of
        Google Research, our team has charted a long-term <a href="https://quantumai.google/roadmap"
            target="_blank">roadmap</a>, and Willow moves us significantly along that path
        towards commercially relevant applications.

    <h2>
        Exponential quantum error correction — below threshold!
    </h2>
    <p>
        Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing, since qubits, the units of computation in
        quantum computers, have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult
        to protect the information needed to complete a computation. Typically the more qubits you use, the more errors
        will occur, and the system becomes classical.

        <br><br>

        Today in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y" target="_blank">Nature</a>, we published
        results showing that the <b><a href="https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/"
                target="_blank">more qubits we use in Willow, the more we <i>reduce</i> errors</a>,
            and the more quantum the system becomes.</b> We tested ever-larger arrays of physical qubits, scaling up
        from a grid
        of 3x3 encoded qubits, to a grid of 5x5, to a grid of 7x7 — and each time, using our latest advances in quantum
        error correction, we were able to cut the error rate in half. In other words, we achieved an exponential
        reduction in the error rate. This historic accomplishment is known in the field as <q>below threshold</q> —
        being
        able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits. You must demonstrate being below threshold to
        show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since <a
            href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493" target="_blank">quantum error
            correction</a> was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.

        <br><br>

        There are other scientific <q>firsts</q> involved in this result as well. For example, it's also one of the
        first
        compelling examples of real-time error correction on a superconducting quantum system — crucial for any useful
        computation, because if you can't correct errors fast enough, they ruin your computation before it's done. And
        it's a <q>beyond breakeven</q> demonstration, where our arrays of qubits have longer lifetimes than the
        individual
        physical qubits do, an unfakable sign that error correction is improving the system overall.

        <br><br>

        As the first system below threshold, this is the most convincing prototype for a scalable logical qubit built to
        date. It's a strong sign that useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built. Willow brings us closer
        to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that can't be replicated on conventional computers.
    </p>
    <h2>
        10 septillion years on one of today's fastest supercomputers
    </h2>
    <p>
        As a measure of Willow's performance, we used the <a
            href="https://research.google/blog/validating-random-circuit-sampling-as-a-benchmark-for-measuring-quantum-progress/"
            target="_blank">random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark</a>. Pioneered by our team
        and now widely used as a standard in the field, RCS is the classically hardest benchmark that can be done on a
        quantum computer today. You can think of this as an entry point for quantum computing — it checks whether a
        quantum computer is doing something that couldn't be done on a classical computer. Any team building a quantum
        computer should check first if it can beat classical computers on RCS; otherwise there is strong reason for
        skepticism that it can tackle more complex quantum tasks. We've consistently used this benchmark to assess
        progress from one generation of chip to the next — we reported Sycamore results in <a
            href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/" target="_blank">October
            2019</a> and again
        recently in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07998-6" target="_blank">October 2024</a>.

        <br><br>

        Willow's performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a computation in under five minutes that
        would take one of today's <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/" target="_blank">fastest
            supercomputers</a> 10<sup>25</sup> or 10 septillion years. If you want to write it
        out, it's
        10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and
        vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many
        parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality" target="_blank">prediction</a> first made by
        David
        Deutsch.

        <br><br>

        These latest results for Willow, as shown in the plot below, are our best so far, but we’ll continue to make
        progress.

            Computational costs are heavily influenced by available memory. Our estimates therefore <br>consider a range
            of scenarios, from an ideal situation with unlimited memory (▲) to<br>a more practical, embarrassingly
            parallelizable implementation on GPUs (⬤).
        </mark>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
        Our assessment of how Willow outpaces one of the world's most powerful classical supercomputers, Frontier, was
        based on conservative assumptions. For example, we assumed full access to secondary storage, i.e., hard drives,
        without any bandwidth overhead — a generous and unrealistic allowance for Frontier. Of course, as happened after
        we announced the first beyond-classical computation in 2019, we expect classical computers to keep improving on
        this benchmark, but the rapidly growing gap shows that quantum processors are peeling away at a double
        exponential rate and will continue to vastly outperform classical computers as we scale up.

        quantum computers.

    <h2>State-of-the-art performance</h2>
    <p>
        Willow was fabricated in our new, state-of-the-art fabrication facility in Santa Barbara — one of only a few
        facilities in the world built from the ground up for this purpose. System engineering is key when designing and
        fabricating quantum chips: All components of a chip, such as single and two-qubit gates, qubit reset, and
        readout, have to be simultaneously well engineered and integrated. If any component lags or if two components
        don't function well together, it drags down system performance. Therefore, maximizing system performance informs
        all aspects of our process, from chip architecture and fabrication to gate development and calibration. The
        achievements we report assess quantum computing systems holistically, not just one factor at a time.

        <br><br>

        We're focusing on quality, not just quantity — because just producing larger numbers of qubits doesn't help if
        they're not high enough quality. With 105 qubits, Willow now has best-in-class performance across the two system
        benchmarks discussed above: quantum error correction and random circuit sampling. Such algorithmic benchmarks
        are the best way to measure overall chip performance. Other more specific performance metrics are also
        important; for example, our T1 times, which measure how long qubits can retain an excitation — the key quantum
        computational resource — are now approaching 100 µs (microseconds). This is an impressive ~5x improvement over
        our previous generation of chips. If you want to evaluate quantum hardware and compare across platforms, here is
        a table of key specifications:

        What's next with Willow and beyond
    </h2>
    <p>
        The next challenge for the field is to demonstrate a first <q>useful, beyond-classical</q> computation on
        today's quantum chips that is relevant to a real-world application. We're optimistic that the Willow generation
        of chips can help us achieve this goal. So far, there have been two separate types of experiments. On the one
        hand, we've run the RCS benchmark, which measures performance against classical computers but has no known
        real-world applications. On the other hand, we've done scientifically interesting simulations of quantum
        systems, which have led to new scientific discoveries but are still within the reach of classical computers. Our
        goal is to do both at the same time — to step into the realm of algorithms that are beyond the reach of
        classical computers <b>and</b> that are useful for real-world, commercially relevant problems.

        My colleagues sometimes ask me why I left the burgeoning field of AI to focus on quantum computing. My answer is
        that both will prove to be the most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced AI will
        significantly benefit from access to quantum computing. This is why I named our lab Quantum AI. Quantum
        algorithms have fundamental scaling laws on their side, as we're seeing with RCS. There are similar scaling
        advantages for many foundational computational tasks that are essential for AI. So quantum computation will be
        indispensable for collecting training data that's inaccessible to classical machines, training and optimizing
        certain learning architectures, and modeling systems where quantum effects are important. This includes helping
        us discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars, and accelerating progress in
        fusion and new energy alternatives. Many of these future game-changing applications won't be feasible on
        classical computers; they're waiting to be unlocked with quantum computing.
